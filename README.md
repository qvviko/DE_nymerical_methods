# Differential Equation Practicum

Variant 25

## Report and code is in notebook
It can be viewed in [github](https://github.com/qvviko/DE_nymerical_methods/blob/master/Differential%20Equaition%20Practicum.ipynb) (though it will not render graphs).

Else it can be viewed in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qvviko/DE_nymerical_methods/blob/master/Differential%20Equaition%20Practicum.ipynb), [or just add any link at this website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) (though it will not render jupyter's interact).

Finally, you can try starting it on you own machine by installing [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [other packages used](./requirements.txt).

I also exported [graphs of methods, global and local errors](./Graphs) into another folder if one wants to look only at them
